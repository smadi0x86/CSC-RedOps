# Passive Information Gathering
```
Also known as Open Source Intelligence, the goal is to optain information that expands the attack surface, either by phishing or password attacks etc...
We never communicate with the target directly, we can rely on third parties for information.
We can only interact as a normal user but never scan or access the vulnerablities of target system or server in this phase.
